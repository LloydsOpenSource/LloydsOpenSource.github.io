## Contributing

To make small content changes it is easier to make the change directly on GitHub.  Navigate to the document you wish to update and click the pencil icon in the top right hand corner.
When you have completed your update add a comment in the box provided at the bottom of the page and then click the "Propose File Change" button. Your changes will then be submitted for review. 

## Usage

Files can be edited on the [Github site](https://github.com/LloydsOpenSource/LloydsOpenSource.github.io/), or locally. For full instructions on how to edit files locally using Jekyll, [follow the tutorial on 24 ways](http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/).

All documents are formatted in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

Jekyll generates the raw files in the <i>_site</i> folder, so do not edit any of the files in there.
